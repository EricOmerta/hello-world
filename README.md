# hello-world

I was thinking that it would be great to learn how to code and program and hack.  I thought this because these skills are the most powerful and profitabe in the world.

I used to be an ace back in Commodore 64 days.  A lot has changed since then.  So, call me "C64".  I'm good with that name...
